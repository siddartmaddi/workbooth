Students often face an issue of finding teammates or collaborators for the projects that they want to work on.
With the ongoing pandemic, the situation has worsened with every academic/professional activity moving online. 
Students have no interaction with the world outside and hence no ways to find collaborators with the same interest.
Workbooth provides the platform where students can collaborate together and interact with each other in projects as well 
as in group studies.
